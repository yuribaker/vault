 - The user could give standardized policies to application or environment owners with namespaces. 

 - And a log aggregation service like Elastic or Splunk or something else can notify the user,
   to give the option to review in case that policy is authorizing some sensitive watchlist of API resource paths.

 - This would give a way to _watch_ namespaces for unexpected behavior, while still gaining
   the self-service benefits.
